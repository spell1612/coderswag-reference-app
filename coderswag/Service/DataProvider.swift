class DataProvider{
    static let SelfInstance=DataProvider() //a static self instantiation inside the class, into the object SelfInstance. This is done to make it a singleton class. ie, a class in which each object takes only the same memory locationfor its entire lifetime, wiping the previous data.
    //In object-oriented programming, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time.
//    After first time, if we try to instantiate the Singleton class, the new variable also points to the first instance created. So whatever modifications we do to any variable inside the class through any instance, it affects the variable of the single instance created and is visible if we access that variable through any variable of that class type defined.
